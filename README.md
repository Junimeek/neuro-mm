## Download
### Latest Release
Currently, this song pack is in Beta Version `0.1` with only one song (BOOM; the others will be completed at a later date, I just wanted to push something out).

The recommended way to download this mod is through DivaModManager. If you already have it installed, click [this link](divamodmanager:dma/293) and it'll start installing the mod, or you can go to the **DMA Mods** tab and search for "Neuro-sama Song Pack".

Alternatively, a download link can be found in the releases on this repository, or on the [Diva Mod Archive](https://divamodarchive.com/post/293) website. ~~Whenever~~ If all four songs are completed, I will be uploading this to GameBanana as well.

## Cloning this Repository
**Everything beyond this point is for all zero people who want to screw around with the source.**

Note that the videos will not be included in this repository since Git doesn't play nice with large files. They're just direct rips of the YouTube uploads tho, so you can just use something like []() yt-dlp to download the videos yourself and re-encode them to a framerate that Comfy Studio will be happy with (24fps for Seishun, 60fps for BOOM).

### Required Software
You must be in the Project DIVA Modding 2nd Discord server to access these tools.

- Comfy Studio
- MikuMikuModel
- WannaCriCS (not to be confused)
- Database Converter
- any DSC script editor
